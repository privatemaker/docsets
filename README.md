docsets
=======

Scripts and configs to build `.docset` bundles for offline readers:

- [DASH](https://kapeli.com/dash), Mac only 
- [Zeal](https://zealdocs.org), cross-platform + open-source ❤️

There are various documentation bundles out there which are not yet a [supported
docset](https://kapeli.com/dash#docsets). This is my humble effort to bundle
docs that I need to read offline, I aim to do the following docs:

- [-] [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) - static-site generator

To-Do

- [ ] [Nextcloud Developer Manual](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/developer_manual/)
- [ ] [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com) - interactive slideshows on the web, in JavaScript
- [ ] [Decap CMS](https://www.decapcms.org) - configurable headless CMS for static-sites

*This is an experiment, I am still figuring out how to best make these.*
